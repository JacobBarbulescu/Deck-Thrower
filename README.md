## Gameplay

Fight rooms full of enemies and build up your deck with killer cards. Throw these cards at your enemies to defeat them and live to see another round.

In the dungeon you can find a merchant who will trade you card to build your perfect deck of cards.

#### There are multiple card types with unique abilities:
